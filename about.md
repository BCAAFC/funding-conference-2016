## How does it work?

At the event there will be presentations by each funding organization in the main hall approximately every 20 minutes.

For each funder there will be an opportunity for delegates to schedule short 15-minute private meetings in which the delegate and the funder can discuss opportunities and address specific questions.


## Who should attend?

We recommend that organizations send their program managers or financial controllers from First Nations and Aboriginal Organizations.
