This event will bring together 60 federal, provincial, public, and private funders to share their funding opportunities with 400 delegates from First Nations and Indigenous Organizations. The presentations will be 15min to the plenary, then break into one on one meetings in smaller rooms to discuss further funding details with delegates. These meetings will be available for sign-up-on-site. The idea is to get everyone at one event to hear about various funding options. Each presentation will be for one funding area and the person speaking about the funding opportunity will be the expert responsible for that funding area. 

We are inviting presenters from private corporations, federal or provincial funders, foundations and international organizations who provide funding to First Nations and Indigenous Organizations. Funding areas include, but not limited to are: 

* Indigenous Career Development
* Arts, Culture, & Language

* Community Project Grants
