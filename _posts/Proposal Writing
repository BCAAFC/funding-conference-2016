#The Event

The BC Indigenous Funding Conference is hosted by the BC Association of Aboriginal Friendship Centres September 21 â€“ 23, 2016. 
Held on the traditional territory of the Musqueam People, this conference facilitates innovative connections and information 
sharing through conference wide presentations, an evening reception and one-on-one conversations. The BC Indigenous Funding 
Conference will bridge the gap between and share information amongst funders and Indigenous communities from across the province.
